## Used Cars Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a used cars dataset. The analysis includes insights into pricing trends, popular car types, mileage effects, and other critical features, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to:

Analyze used car listings to uncover patterns and insights.
Identify factors influencing car pricing and popularity.
Visualize key metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

## Features Analyzed
  •	Most Popular Car Types: Identifies the top 5 most frequently listed car types.
  •	Distribution by Title Status: Explores how cars are distributed based on their title status.
  •	Trend Over Time: Analyzes how car listings vary over time.
  •	Price Changes by Year: Visualizes average price trends across car manufacturing years.
  •	Most Popular Condition: Highlights the most common car conditions.
  •	Price vs Distance Relationship: Examines the effect of odometer readings on car prices.
  •	Correlation Analysis: Finds correlations between price, mileage, and engine cylinders.
  •	Fuel Type Analysis: Explores how fuel type impacts car pricing.
  •	Manufacturer-Based Pricing: Computes the average price for different car manufacturers.
  •	Distribution of Cars by Cylinders: Visualizes the number of cars by cylinder count.
  •	State-Wise Analysis: Identifies which U.S. states have the most car listings.
  •	Geographic Distribution: Maps car listings based on their location.

## Tools and Libraries Used
  •	**Python:** Core programming language for data analysis.
  •	**Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
  •	**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization.
  •	**NumPy:** Numerical operations.
  •	**Geopandas (optional):** For geographic mapping.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

       git clone https://github.com/username/used-cars-eda.git
       cd used-cars-eda

2. Install the required Python libraries:

       pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

        jupyter notebook used-cars-eda.ipynb

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data/data?authuser=0'.
The data includes attributes such as price, mileage, manufacturer, fuel type, location, and more.

## Key Visualizations
  •	Bar charts for popular car types and manufacturers.
  •	Line charts showing trends in pricing and listings over time.
  •	Scatter plots to examine relationships between price, mileage, and other features.
  •	Geographic maps to visualize the distribution of cars across the U.S.

## Future Work
  •	Add machine learning models for car price prediction.
  •	Perform deeper analysis of geographic trends using advanced mapping tools.
  •	Automate data cleaning for scalability across other datasets.
